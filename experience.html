					<h2>Foundations of Data Science Lead Teaching Assistant(TA) and TA</h2>

					<p> 
						I led weekly lab sessions for 30–45 students, teaching foundational data science and analytics concepts using Python and Jupyter notebooks. 
						In collaboration with course staff, I helped design and refine assignments, labs, and tutoring materials to improve the learning experience. 
						As a lead teaching assistant in Spring 2024, I co-managed course logistics for an introductory data science course with over 1,300 students. 
						This included developing SQL queries and Python scripts to automate data workflows, managing student performance tracking in Google Sheets, and coordinating exam logistics and policy communication through an organized strategy.

					<p> Built a command-line version control system from scratch, inspired by Git. The system supports key version control operations including init, add, commit, checkout, log, status, branch, merge, and reset.</p>
					<p>Designed core data structures to manage commit trees, staging areas, and file tracking using object serialization and custom file system logic. Developed robust unit and integration tests to validate correctness and consistency. Authored a comprehensive design document detailing the system architecture, command behavior, and implementation strategy.</p>

					<p> I cleaned and preprocessed a dataset of 407,000 customer records and engineered features—such as bulk purchase indicators—to better understand customer behavior. Using K-Means clustering and RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, I segmented customers to uncover actionable insights into purchasing patterns. I also created data visualizations to highlight key trends and segment characteristics, helping to deepen the overall understanding of customer profiles.</p>

					<p> I analyzed 32,000 rows of sales data using SQL and Python to uncover key trends such as year-over-year performance, top-performing product categories, and states with the highest customer engagement. To support deeper insights, I developed interactive Tableau dashboards that visualized sales and profit distributions across product categories and geographic regions.</p>
