                    Hello! My name is Gamaliel, Gamy for short, Aguas. I am a 2024 UC Berkeley grad who majored in
                    Applied Math, with a cluster in Data Science, and Computer Science. 
                    <br>
                    I do have an interest in working with data, I love to play around with it so I can see the story 
                    it is trying to tell. With that said having an interest in data also helped to foster my interest in programming,
                    I try to build scripts or web apps for personal use, to explore my what ifs or just to code for the fun of it.
                    <br>
                    I am eager and excited to put my skills in java, python, sql, spring boot applications, data visualizations
                    and data analysis to use! If you're wondering on what I can do check out my experience page!
                    <br>
                    Fun facts I love listening to music (130K mins on my spotify wrapped), mostly to kpop (favorite group ZB1), laufey or
                    spanish pop.
